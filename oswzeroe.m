% INPUT:
%
% fid          The file id (from FOPEN)
% scl          The scaling factors for the Fisher matrix 
% avH          The full-form sample-average Hessian matrix
% good         The number of samples over which this was averaged
% F            The full-form scaled Fisher matrix
% covF         The full-form theoretical covariance matrix, based on F
% fmtc/e/f     Strings containing formatting instructions

% Print the scaling of the theoretical values

% Now print the theoretical covariance to file also
fprintf(fid,'%s\n','the theoretical covariance');
fprintf(fid,fmtf,trilos(covF));

% Print the scaled Fisher matrix, the expected value of the Hessian
fprintf(fid,'%s\n','the unblurred scaled Fisher matrix');
fprintf(fid,fmte,trilos(F));

% Print the observed average of the Hessians (over last set of runs)
fprintf(fid,'%s\n',...
