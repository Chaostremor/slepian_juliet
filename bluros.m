%
% Spectral blurring with periodogram of a boxcar. If we're talking about a
% matrix, there are three columns, and there can be an eigenvalue check.
% This is the approximate, slower, convolutional way which requires a "grid
% refinement" parameter. Later, will build in other types of windows.
%
% INPUT:
%
% S       The spectral matrix with its wavenumbers unwrapped, on a
%         wavenumber grid that was refined from the original
%         For univariate spectra, it's a column vector. 
%         For bivariate spectra, it's [S_XX(k(:)) SXY(k(:)) SYY(k(:))]
% params  Parameters of this experiment, the ones that are needed are:
%         dydx  sampling interval in the y and x directions [m m]
%         NyNx  number of samples in the y and x directions
%         blurs 0 Don't blur likelihood using the Fejer window
%               1 With no refinement, this is like not blurring at all!
%               N Blur likelihood using the Fejer window [default: N=2]
%              -1 Blur likelihood using the exact BLUROSY procedure
% xver    1 Extra verification, among other ways, via BLURCHECK
%         0 No checking at all
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% Sbar    The blurred spectral matrix, interpolated to original requested
%         dimension as identified by 'params' from the input
% k       The wavenumber matrix (the norm of the wave vectors), unwrapped
%
% SEE ALSO:
%
% SIMULOSL, BLUROSY
%
% NOTES:
%
% It looks to me that keeping blurs to an ODD number performs the best from
% either even- or odd-sized inputs, despite the parity fix effectuated in
% KNUMS. This from running and plotting lots of simulations in EGGERS1.
%
% Maybe should formally increase it in those cases so as to never worry?
