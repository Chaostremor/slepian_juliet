function Sk=maternosp(k,th,params,xver)
% Sk=maternosp(k,th,params,xver)
%
% Calculates the three-parameter isotropic d-dimensional Matern
% spectral density used by Olhede & Simons (2013), with or without
% blurring, exact or not. 
%
%INPUT:
%
% k        Wavenumber(s), e.g. from KNUM2 [rad/m], not always needed
% th       The unscaled parameter vector, with, in the last three slots: 
%          s2   The first Matern parameter [variance in units^2]
%          nu   The second Matern parameter [differentiability]
%          rho  The third Matern parameter [range in m]
% params   A structure with AT LEAST these constants that are known:
%          dydx  sampling interval in the y and x directions [m m]
%          NyNx  number of samples in the y and x directions
%          blurs 0 Don't blur likelihood using the Fejer window
%                N Blur likelihood using the Fejer window [default: N=2]
%               -1 Blur likelihood using the exact procedure
% xver     1 Perform excessive verification
%          0 Don't 
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% Sk       A column vector with all the wavenumbers unwrapped

    % If I stay on the same k-grid, I'm really not doing any convolution at
    % all as you can see quickly. So by "suitably discretizing" the
    % convolutional operator we mean: performing it on a highly densified
    % grid of which the target grid may be a subset. Doing this on the
    % same grid would be the "inverse crime" of NOT changing the grid
    % all. Run Fk for this case to see it then would be a delta function.

    % Blurs IS the refinement parameter; make new wavenumber grid. Make the
    % spectral-spectral portion of the spectral matrix, convolve in two
    % dimensions, and then subsample onto the original target grid
