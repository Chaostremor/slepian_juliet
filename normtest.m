function [pf,pv,pr,alfa]=normtest(stat,mn,vr,alfa)
% [pf,pv,pr,alfa]=NORMTEST(stat,mn,vr,alfa)
%
% Test whether a particular value is derived from a hypothesized NORMAL
% (GAUSSIAN) distribution with known (postulated) mean and variance,
% reject if the probability of more extreme than observed values are very
% unlikely, e.g. below (1-alfa)x100 percent. This is a TWO-SIDED test
% where the algorithm depends on the symmetry of the distribution. It is
% a ONE-SAMPLE test for every ELEMENT of the array offered (i.e. quite
% literally one sample, of one point, each), unlike ZTEST.
%
% INPUT: 
%
% stat      The value being tested, could be a vector or a matrix
% mn        The expected value of the normal distribution under the null [0]
% vr        The variance of the  normal distribution under the null [1]
% alfa      The significance level [0.05] for a (1-alfa)x100 confidence
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% pf        0 if it PASSES, i.e. the statistic is derived from the null
%           1 if it FAILS, i.e. the statistic is REJECTED to be from null 
% pv        The 'p-value' of having an even more extreme value of the test
% pr        The percentage of the test values that are being rejected,
%           useful if you give a whole vector of stat values
% alfa      The significance level [0.05] for a (1-alfa)x100 confidence
% 
% EXAMPLE:
%
% mu=randn; vr=rand; al=randi(100)/100; mn=randi(1e3);
% [a,b,c]=normtest(randn(mn,1),0,1,al);
% disp(sprintf('%i%% rejected at the %i%% confidence level',...
%            round(c),round(al*100)))

% ONE-SAMPLE TEST ON THE MEAN
% This is the probability of a test value even more extremely removed, in
% the absolute sense, from the predicted mean given the standard deviation
pv=1-2*abs(normcdf(stat,mn,sqrt(vr))-1/2);
% This is the test, reject gives a 1
pf=pv<alfa;
% This is the report on the rejections
pr=sum(pf)/length(pf)*100;

% Provide an uplifting message
